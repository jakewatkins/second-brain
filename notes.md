The idea is to setup a system that allows me to quickly throw ideas somewhere and they will be remembers and kept useful
This is based on content created by Nate Jones.
The YouTube video is here: https://youtu.be/0TpON5T-Sw4?si=XbWPN1orPOqFuQ3G
His substack post is here: [Why every system you've tried has failed + grab the 90-minute guide to one that won't](https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/grab-the-system-that-closes-open)


We'll start off building Nate's system:
- messages will come in through Slack.  I've created a workspace and a channel for this (jake.watkins@gmail.com)
- I've created an account w/ Zapier (jakew@guerillaprogrammer.com)
- I've created a notion account (jakew@guerillaprogrammer.com)
- already have Gemini account (jakew@guerillaprogrammer.com)
Need to create the workflows
