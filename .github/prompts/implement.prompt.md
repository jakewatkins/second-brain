CP, please use the file "{{file}}" along with the implementation plan in "plan.md" to generate the complete program described in the requirements. The review and planning phases are finished, and the requirements are considered clear and implementation-ready.

Your task is to produce high-quality, production-ready code that follows the plan and fulfills all requirements. Please:

- Follow the architecture, structure, and sequencing defined in plan.md.
- Generate all necessary files, modules, classes, functions, and configuration.
- Use clear, maintainable, idiomatic code appropriate for the chosen language or framework.
- Include comments where helpful for clarity.
- Implement error handling, validation, and edge-case coverage as described in the plan.
- Ensure the code is consistent with the requirements and acceptance criteria.
- If the plan references external services, APIs, or integrations, include stubs or full implementations as appropriate.
- If any part of the plan or requirements appears contradictory or incomplete, pause and call it out before proceeding.

Output the code in a structured, organized way so a developer can copy it directly into a project. If multiple files are required, clearly label each file and its path.

Keep the implementation focused, complete, and aligned with the plan.
