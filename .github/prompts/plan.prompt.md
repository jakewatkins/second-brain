CP, please read the file "{{file}}"{{#if requirement}} and focus specifically on Requirement {{requirement}}{{/if}}. The review process has been completed, and the requirements are now considered clear and implementation-ready.

Using the referenced content, create a detailed implementation plan that can be followed by either human developers or AI developers. The plan should:

- Break the work into clear, sequential phases or steps.
- Identify any dependencies, prerequisites, or setup tasks.
- Describe the architecture, components, modules, or services involved.
- Outline data structures, APIs, integrations, or workflows as needed.
- Highlight potential risks, edge cases, or decisions that must be made.
- Provide guidance on testing, validation, and acceptance criteria.
- Include any recommended tools, libraries, or patterns.

The plan should be actionable, unambiguous, and structured so that a developer can begin implementation immediately. If anything in the requirements appears incomplete or contradictory, call it out before proceeding.

Keep the plan concise but thorough.

Save the plan in a file named "plan.md" in the same directory as the referenced file.
